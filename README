"srk_ps3_1.jl" contains the main script for all parts
-For part a, get the original stoichiometric matrix by printing stoichiometric_matrix_original
-For part b, get the balanced E matrix by printing "E_balanced". Get the atom matrix from "atom_balanced" 
and stoichiometric matrix from "stoichiometric_matrix_balanced"

"upper_bound_math.jl" calculates the upper bounds for part c

"convert.jl" allows for a subfunction to convert from uM to ummol/gDW to be used

"flux.jl" is the function used in part c 

the pdf file contains all the formal write-up and explanations of the problem set
