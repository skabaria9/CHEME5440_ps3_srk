the pdf file "CHEME_7770_pset3.pdf" contains all the formal write-up and explanations of the problem set 

"srk_ps3_1.jl" contains the main script for all parts
-For part a, get the original stoichiometric matrix by printing "stoichiometric_matrix_original"
-For part b, get the balanced E matrix by printing "E_balanced" or "E_balanced2" Get the atom matrix from "atom_balanced" 
and stoichiometric matrix from "stoichiometric_matrix_balanced" or "stoichiometric_matrix_balanced"
-For part c, get the flux array by printing "calculated_flux_array" or "calculated_flux_array2" (units: umol/gDW-s)
-For part c, get the flux array by printing "calculated_flux_array_converted" or "calculated_flux_array_converted2" (units: mmol/gDW-hr)

"upper_bound_math.jl" calculates the upper bounds for part c

"convert.jl" allows for a subfunction to convert from uM to ummol/gDW to be used

"flux.jl" is the function used in part c
